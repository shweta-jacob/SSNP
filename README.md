# SSNP: Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling

SSNP (Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling) is a fork of [GLASS](https://github.com/Xi-yuanWang/GLASS). SSNP uses subgraph neighborhoods during pooling to increase the expressiveness of plain-GNNs on subgraph classification.

#### Prepare Data

The realworld datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zv7gw2bqzqev9yn/AACR9iR4Ok7f9x1fIAiVCdj3a?dl=0).
